# Augmented Reality (AR)
Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information.
AR can be defined as a system that fulfills three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects.

# AR Android Application
An android application developed to implement AR (Augmented Reality) for the purpose of smart learning.
This is the software development project that I did in my second year of computer engineering.
This technology can be best implemented in **Medical Science** domain as we can study the human anatomy with the help of 3D real-world models of human organs like brain, heart, etc. without need of any physical organs.
